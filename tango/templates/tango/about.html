            <h2>Operational Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Timing, Accuracy, and Degree of Force are critical elements for creating the security shield around the assets we wish to secure and defend. As the law of nature suggests - 'The Survival of The Fittest', something similar applies in the Security domain. It is - 'Creating a significant threat, for a threat, that creates the ultimate deterrence against that threat.' In other words, you do not grab a hot pan because you know you'd burn your hand. 

                At TSoC, we create security designs that reflect a significant threat to those who intend to invade and disrupt normalcy. It's our way of creating an effective deterrence mechanism. Our 5 P's methodology (Predict, Prepare, Protect, Prevent, & Preserve) ensures that all aspects of threat identification & mitigation are observed. Both 'Low Probability - High Impact' to those which are High Probability - Low Impact.</p>

<h1> Our Values</h1>
<br>
<br>
<section class="about">  
<div class="about-content">
    <h2>CARE</h2>
    <p> One of the toughest tasks we have thus far encountered and accomplished is training victims of crime into future warriors. 
        The only element that helped us during this training was our genuine care for them, their families and in some cases their children. 
        We cared because a victim more often raises either a victim, or an extreme case of an aggressor. 
        Today they are raising a generation who will not just be a survivor but also never be a bystander to crime and abuse.</p>
       <br>
    <h2>DEPENDABILITY</h2>
    <p>Why would you waste your precious time and money if we couldn't prove ourselves dependable in times when you need expert advice or training assistance to help you build your counter crime resilience to keep yourself and your loved ones secured and safe? 
       In every interaction we have, we strive hard to prove ourselves - irrespective of the testimonies we have from the past.</p>
       <br>
     <h2>TRUST</h2>
       <p>In times of peril/danger, we think of God or our parents. We know that they are the only ones who would come to our rescue unconditionally. 
          Your time + your money + your efforts + our expertise + our commitment + our time will turn you into a trust worthy friend in need. 
          Your friends will now think of you along with their other options in times of peril.</p>
          <br> 
    <h2>INTEGRITY</h2>
          <p>During our trainings, many share their inner most feelings, their dreaded experiences, their private moments of shame when they were being victimised. 
             They do so because they know of our integrity to keep what is theirs as guarded as if it was ours. 
             There can be NO SECURITY without Integrity. And we swear by ours.</p>
             <br> 
    <h2>RESPECT</h2>
             <p>We respect your fears. Your vulnerabilities. Your limitations to act against what is wrong. 
                But we respect your security and safety a little more. We respect your dignity and right to personal and social security. 
                And that is what will remain our foremost priority during our interaction. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

    <h2>Martial Arts For Kids?...A BAD IDEA!</h2>
    <p>A common perspective that is built on the movies we see of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan or the Karate Kid and his coach Miyagi, makes us believe that it's all one needs to learn to stay safe.
       Martial arts is however not really that. In a span of few hours, a kid getting bullied transforms into a fighter like none other. 
       But this happens only in REEL Life.</p>
